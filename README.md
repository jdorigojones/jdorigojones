- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @johnnydorigojones
- ðŸ‘€ I am a PhD candidate at CU Boulder. Below you will find resources for one of the undergraduate courses I have been teaching assistant for.
- My research focuses on applying neural networks to more accurately model the global 21-cm signal, and also analyzing Earth's Auroral Kilometric radiation using observations by radio frequency telescopes on the Moon.
- I have not released software/code for any of my previous projects because the analyses utilized all publicly available softwares/codes, and detailed description in my published papers facilitate reproducability of the analyses. I am happy to provide the full training and test set labels and data for the fully-connected neural network used in my previous paper upon request.
