- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @johnnydorigojones
- ðŸ‘€ I am a PhD candidate at CU Boulder. My research currently focuses on applying neural networks to more accurately model the global 21-cm signal, and also analyzing radio frequency observations of Earth's Auroral Kilometric radiation. I have not released software/code for any of my previous projects because the analyses utilized all publicly available softwares/codes, and detailed description in my published papers facilitate reproducability of the analyses. I am happy to provide the full training and test set labels and data for the fully-connected neural network used in my previous paper upon request.
